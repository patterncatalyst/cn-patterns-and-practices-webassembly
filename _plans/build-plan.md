# Build & Iteration Plan — API Patterns and Practices: Server-Side WebAssembly

Fifth site in the series (REST → gRPC → GraphQL → WebSockets → this one). A
deliberate deviation from the first four: this site teaches a **runtime and
deployment target**, not an API style. Kubernetes deployment is the point of
the book, not an appendix bolted on at the end.
This document covers **r01 — bootstrap scaffold** only: site chrome, the
locked outline, and the plans ledger. No chapter prose, no runnable examples,
and no WIT contract body are written in r01.

Repo: `patterncatalyst/cn-patterns-and-practices-webassembly` (public,
remote-first). The `cn-` (cloud-native) prefix marks the
deviation from the four `api-` siblings — this is a runtime/deployment site,
not an API style — while the hub still places it under Cloud Native / API
design alongside REST/gRPC/GraphQL/WebSockets (DRQ-001).

## r01 scope (this iteration)

- Site chrome copied from `api-patterns-and-practices-websockets`: layouts,
  includes, CSS, codetabs JS, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `Gemfile`,
  `Gemfile.lock`, `LICENSE`, the Pages CI workflow.
- `_config.yml` and `index.html` adapted for identity only (title,
  description, emoji, repo name, baseurl, hero copy, stat tiles).
- The outline locked: 8 Parts (`_parts/`), 30 `_docs/` files (the outline
  page plus Ch0–Ch28), front matter only except Part 0 and Part 1, which
  carry section headings with no prose.
- `scripts/generate_diagram.py` copied with the light-ink emphasis-box
  palette already correct (DRQ-008) — no dark-fill bug to carry forward from
  this source, unlike the gRPC-to-WebSockets handoff.
- `scripts/wordcount.sh` (warn above 2,500 prose words, fail below 2,000),
  copied from the WebSockets sibling.
- Nav stub pages (`_example_pages/index.md`, `bibliography.md`) so the header
  and footer links resolve to a real, if empty, page.
- `contracts/` reserved with a `README.md` placeholder only — the WIT world
  body and its drift-gate CI land in r02+.
- This plan, the decisions log, and a dated placeholder version matrix.

No chapter prose, no runnable examples, and no WIT contract body are written
in r01.

## Locked outline

**Part 0 — Prerequisites**: Ch0 Setup and the lab.
**Part 1 — Foundations**: Ch1–Ch5.
**Part 2 — Building Components in Rust & Go**: Ch6–Ch10.
**Part 3 — Interfaces: HTTP & gRPC**: Ch11–Ch13.
**Part 4 — Runtimes: wasmtime & wasmCloud**: Ch14–Ch16.
**Part 5 — Deploying to Kubernetes**: Ch17–Ch24. Ch19 is OpenShift Local
(CRC) as a **numbered chapter inside this Part**, not an appendix. Ch22 is
HPA/scaling patterns; Ch23 is serverless scale-to-zero with KEDA.
**Part 6 — Deviations**: Ch25 Istio + Wasm, Ch26 other backend architectures
(a survey, anchored on Spin), Ch27 wasi-nn.
**Part 7 — Final Project**: Ch28.

29 chapters, numbered **0–28, gap-free** — no `99-appendix` file. CRC is a
numbered chapter because deploying to Kubernetes is this book's whole point,
a deliberate divergence from the four `api-` siblings, where CRC is a
non-numbered appendix (DRQ-007).

## Deferred to later iterations (r02+)

- Chapter prose for all 29 chapters, to the house depth standard: paired
  SVG+Excalidraw diagrams, the house chapter spine (Learning objectives +
  Why this matters at the top, For deeper coverage at the end).
- Runnable examples under `examples/`, every example built in **both Rust and
  Go** against one shared WIT world, each with its own verify step.
- The WIT contract body under `contracts/` (the Component Model interfaces
  this site teaches), plus the CI WIT-drift gate that regenerates both
  language bindings and fails the build on drift.
- minikube manifests (containerd Wasm shim + wasmCloud operator + Istio) and
  the CRC deployment tier — both verified live headless.
- A dev compose for supporting services plus the LGTM observability stack.
- The hub entry on `patterncatalyst/workshops-tutorials-list`.
- The companion deck(s) — built LAST, after every chapter and example.

## Release cadence

Iterations ship by Part, never by stack, so the Rust and Go implementations
never diverge. Each iteration ends on a clean `bundle exec jekyll build`.

Roadmap sketch:

- **r01** — scaffold (this iteration).
- **r02** — Part 1 Foundations prose (Ch0–Ch5).
- **r03** — Part 2 Building Components + the first Rust and Go examples +
  the WIT contract spine.
- **r04** — Part 3 Interfaces: HTTP & gRPC.
- **r05** — Part 4 Runtimes: wasmtime & wasmCloud.
- **r06+** — Part 5 Kubernetes deployment tiers: minikube first, then CRC,
  both verified live headless; HPA, then KEDA scale-to-zero.
- **r0N** — Part 6 Deviations: Istio+Wasm, the backend-architecture survey
  (Spin), wasi-nn.
- **r0N** — Part 7 Final project.
- **final** — companion decks, mined from the finished chapters and examples.
